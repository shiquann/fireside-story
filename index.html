    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <P>It actually was a pretty pleasant day. Just being interesting.</P>
    <p>For some reason you thought it was a pleasant night but it was very windy.</p>
    <p>So windy that i had to chase my recycling bin down the block.</p>
    <p>I neen someone chasing a bin. At first I thought it was a dog.</p>
    <p>No dog, but all wind. This story is over. The end.</p>
